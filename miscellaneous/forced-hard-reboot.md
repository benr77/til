Force A Hard Reboot
====

Linux only.

If your machine becomes completely unresponsive, instead of hitting the power or reset buttons, which can damage the machine's components (particularly the hard disk drives), 
you can send a signal to the kernel to reboot the machine.

Press and hold these keys (`PrintScrn` might be `SysRq` on some keyboards):

`ALT` + `PRINTSCRN`

Whilst the above keys are being pressed, then press in quick succession:

`R` `E` `I` `S` `U` `B`

Other interesting things can also be configured.
